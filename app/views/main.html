			<span class="dark-text">Scalable</span><span class="color-green"><b>Learning</b></span> provides teachers and publishers with tools to develop engaging, interactive online material that increases student reflection and interaction. Teachers can then use <span class="dark-text">Scalable</span><span class="color-green"><b>Learning</b></span>’s analytics to gain insights into where students are learning and where they are confused. Teachers can then identify the topics where students need help and <span class="dark-text">Scalable</span><span class="color-green"><b>Learning</b></span> will build a customized in-class review for the material.

		<b>Active Learning:</b> <span class="dark-text">Flipped Classroom and Just-in-time Teaching</span>
	</h3>
	<p>
		<span class="dark-text">Scalable</span><span class="color-green"><b>Learning</b></span> enables active learning by giving teachers and publishers powerful tools for producing interactive online material and understanding students’ online progress. With these tools, teachers can move their lectures online (flipped classroom) and use class time to focus on the areas where students are struggling (just-in-time teaching). This enables more time for directed in-class active learning activities such as peer instruction, problem based learning, group discussion, and problem solving.

		<b>Engaging Students:</b> <span class="dark-text">Interactive Online Material</span>
	</h3>
	<p>
		The <span class="dark-text">Scalable</span><span class="color-green"><b>Learning</b></span> platform provides a unique set of tools to help students engage with the material and encourage them to reflect on what they are learning:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Interactive in-video questions, including multiple choice, drag into order, free response, and matched response
			</li>
			<li>
				Integrated teacher answers to in-video questions 
			</li>
			<li>
				In-video student questions and discussions 
			</li>
			<li>
				Student voting on for in-class review material
			</li>
			<li>
				Surveys and graded quizzes 
			</li>
			<li>
				In-video note taking and student review
			</li>
			<li>
				A “confused” button for students to mark the online material for teachers
			</li>
		</ul>

		<b>Understanding Learning:</b> <span class="dark-text">Teacher Analytics</span>
	</h3>
	<p>
		<span class="dark-text">Scalable</span><span class="color-green"><b>Learning</b></span> provides a detailed breakdown of students’ online performance: video questions and quizzes, student questions and feedback, where students were confused, and what material they would like to see reviewed in-class. This information is combined to make it easy for teachers to quickly review their class’s performance, see exactly where they struggled, respond to questions, and choose which material to review in-class.

		With <span class="dark-text">Scalable</span><span class="color-green"><b>Learning</b></span>, teachers can review an entire class’s lecture performance and answer students’ online questions in 20 minutes. For the first time teachers can show up to class knowing where their students are struggling and what questions they have.

	<p>
		<span class="dark-text">Scalable</span><span class="color-green"><b>Learning</b></span> helps teachers bring the students’ online experience into the classroom by effortlessly reviewing online quizzes, questions, and lecture material in-class. Teachers simply mark material for in-class review, and <span class="dark-text">Scalable</span><span class="color-green"><b>Learning</b></span> builds a custom presentation that focuses on just the material their class struggled with. This tight integration between online and in-class teaching allows teachers to focus their in-class review time and encourages student online interactions.

		Getting Started with <span class="dark-text">Scalable</span><span class="color-green"><b>Learning</b></span>
	</h3>
	<p>
		If you’re a motivated teacher and want to get started with <span class="dark-text">Scalable</span><span class="color-green"><b>Learning</b></span> please get in touch via the Feedback link above. We’ll get you setup with an account, a detailed instructions guide, including tips on how to produce material, motivate students, different ways to run a flipped class, and advice we’ve gathered from working with thousands of students.
	</p>
	<p>
		To get started you should identify how to add interactive questions to your lecture material and develop active learning material for your in-class time. Once you’ve done that for a few lectures it’s time to get started with <span class="dark-text">Scalable</span><span class="color-green"><b>Learning</b></span>. We advise teachers to start out switching over roughly half of their class for the first round to get a better feeling for how to teach in a flipped, just-in-time manner. Our instructions manual has plenty of tips and practical advice for getting started.
