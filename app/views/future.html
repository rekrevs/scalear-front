	<p>While we continue to look for ways to keep ScalableLearning going for the future,<b> our current plans are to
		shut down ScalableLearning at the end of 2020.</b> To help our users,  we are building
		two paths for you to export your courses from ScalableLearning: migrating your videos to the FeedbackFruits
		Interactive Video Tool or exporting your whole course to Canvas or Blackboard. </p>
	
	<p>As of May we support exporting to Canvas, but we hope to have the other paths ready for use shortly </p>
	
	<p>No course data or student data will be migrated or exported without your explicit action.</p>

	<p><b>Option 1: Export to FeedbackFruits Interactive Video Tool</b>
		</br>
		<a href="https://feedbackfruits.com/" style='text-decoration: underline'>FeedbackFruits</a> is an international
		company based in the Netherlands whose mission is to support teachers to create engaging learning activities
		that spark active thinking. FeedbackFruits provides a suite of pedagogical tools to over 35 institutions around the
		world. FeedbackFruits will provide free use of their Interactive Video Tool for ScalableLearning Teachers and an
		automatic migration tool. This will allow you to continue using quizzes and student discussions in your videos.
		The Interactive Video Tool can be used either as a stand-alone tool or embedded in your institution’s LMS.
	</p>

	<p style='color:#38761d'>
		&rarr;To export individual videos to FeedbackFruits Interactive Video Tool simply click on the “Export Video to
		FeedbackFruits” under “Details” for each video and you will receive an email with further instructions. (We hope to have this option available soon.)
	</p>
	<p>If you would like to learn more about Interactive Videos in Canvas or Blackboard please watch the videos below.
		You
		can also contact FeedbackFruits directly at
		</br> <a href="mailto:helpme@feedbackfruits.com">helpme@feedbackfruits.com </a>for assistance.
		</br> Exporting from ScalableLearning to FeedbackFruits:
		</br> For Canvas:<a href="https://youtu.be/6kgwXf_V3hw?t=318" style='text-decoration: underline'>https://youtu.be/6kgwXf_V3hw?t=318</a> 
		</br> For Blackboard:<a href="https://youtu.be/pk3pl-QdNjc?t=292" style='text-decoration: underline'>https://youtu.be/pk3pl-QdNjc?t=292</a> 
	</p>
	<p><b>Option 2: Export to Canvas or Blackboard</b>
		</br>
		We will also provide the option to export your course to the Canvas or Blackboard LMSs. This will allow you to
		import your course structure (modules and videos) into either a free Canvas instance or your institution’s own
		Canvas/Blackboard LMS. However, as neither natively support quizzes in videos, the export tool will split up
		your videos at each quiz. This will require that students click the “next” button to take the quizzes and continue
		the video  (We are working on a version that will export embedded FeedbackFruits videos to overcome this limitation and will provide it as soon as it is ready).
	</p>
	<p style='color:#38761d'>
		&rarr; To export your course, simply click on “Export Course to Canvas” on the “Administration” page for your
		course. You will then receive an email with the exported course and instructions for how to import it into
		Canvas. Currently exporting directly to Blackboard is not supported, and you will need to first export to
		Canvas, then import your course into a free Canvas instance, and finally export it from Canvas to Blackboard. We
		hope to simplify this in the future.

	<div>
		<p>We understand that neither of these paths provide the full online/in-class experience that ScalableLearning
			provides, but we are confident that they will allow you to continue teaching with the material you have
			built up in ScalableLearning.
